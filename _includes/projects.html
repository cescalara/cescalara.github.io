  My current research focuses on understanding the origins of the highest energy particles ever detected, <b>ultra-high-energy cosmic rays</b> (UHECRs). Because of their huge energies, they are thought to be accelerated in energetic astrophysical sources outside of our own Galaxy, but the exact nature of these sources remains unknown. I have worked on both <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.asr.2017.10.044", style="color:#E4646C">new detector technologies</a> that will allow us to detect more of these rare particles and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stz081", style="color:#E4646C">data analysis techniques</a> to fully exploit all the available information in the search for their sources. These days, I'm particularly interested in Bayesian statistical methods and how they can be used to give new insights into long-standing problems in astrophysics.  <!-- Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays produce neutrinos and photons when they interact with matter and radiation fields as they leave thier sources and travel towards us. These days I'm interested in using this "multi-messenger" information to help solve this long-standing problem. -->

    <h3>A hierarchical model for UHECR associations </h3>
    <p> I have developed a Bayesian hierarchical model which enables a joint fit of the UHECR energy spectrum and arrival directions within the context of a physical model for the UHECR phenomenology. Using this approach, we see a higher associated fraction than other work, but the simple physical model is still not able to explain the cosmic rays at the very highest energies, which are the most constraining. This work has been shortlisted for the American Statistical Association's <i>Best Astrostatistics Student Paper Award</i>. The code is <a href="" style="color:#E4646C">open source</a> and documented for reproducibility. </p>

    <h3> The Mini-EUSO instrument </h3>
    <p> The Mini-EUSO instrument is a small UV telescope that was recently launched to the International Space Station. It is designed to prepare for the space-based fluorescence detection of UHECRs. If successful, this technique will be able to dramatically increase the number of UHECRs we are able to observe, thanks to the increase in effective area that comes with being able to view large amounts of the Earth's atmosphere from space. </p>
    <p> I am involved in this project as part of the international JEM-EUSO Collaboration. My contributions include the integration and testing of the instrument hardware and the design and implementation of the level 2 trigger algorithm. I am also responsible for the instrument data acquisition and control software which I have released as <a href="https://github.com/cescalara/minieuso_cpu" style="color:#E4646C">open source</a> with extensive <a href="https://minieuso-software.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" style="color:#E4646C">documentation</a>. </p>
